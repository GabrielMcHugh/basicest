1. Where does getConnectionString get its configuration from? When it's in development does it know to draw form the Development json?
Because thats where I put yje development connection string.

2. Im Setting up the DB Context for the Blog, but I already have a dbConext for the Application (from the --auth flag on the creation of the 
app. Is it better to reconcile these? What is a DB context first of all and why am I using them for here? How would I go about doing that?)
